            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's hard to say definitively what the best
            practices are for Save the World (STW); however, here are a couple
            of things I would do differently if I started over. By the way, my
            Power Level (PL) is already 140, which means I've completed the game
            twice. Completing Canny Valley is considered the first playthrough,
            and finishing Twine and defeating the Mythical Storm King (MSK)
            marks the second completion. I've also completely filled my
            Collection Book for all currently obtainable items.

            Remember getting stuck in Stonewood forever? Avoid that by joining a
            dedicated Fortnite STW server. You'll connect with like-minded

            difficult missions a breeze.

            I used to switch servers to EU, where STW seems much more active
            (like, 200% more!). Maybe explore different regions and find your
            perfect community.

          Fundamentals of Traps and Trapping
        </Text>
        <Flex gap="1" direction="column">
          <Text fontSize="lg">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three types of traps: wall,
            ceiling, and floor traps. Arguably, the best all-around traps are
            ceiling traps. Elevated properly, they're immune to husk damage from
            sploders and smashers. However, their Achilles' heel is the array of
            lobbers. In these cases, we turn to a hybrid solution: anti-air
            traps. A few of them, strategically placed above your base, can be
            the difference between successful ceiling traps and a broken base.

                These darts pack a heavy punch, and they are able to shoot
                through walls that have certain types of openings. I typically
                rely on just a center window opening. And, on that opening, I
                place a Sound Wall. Make sure to place your wall dart between
                1-3 tiles distance.

                These are key in preventing sploders from wrecking your base

                not spawn points since doing so will cause spawn points to
                automatically destory your trap.

                These traps must be place at three walls length vertically, of

                they propel the husk backwards. Accompanying these traps with
                floor freeze traps, can stall many husks from progressing.
